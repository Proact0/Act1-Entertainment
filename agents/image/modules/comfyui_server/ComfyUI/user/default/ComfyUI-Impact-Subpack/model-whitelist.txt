# Add base filenames of trusted models (e.g., my_old_yolo.pt) here, one per line.
# This allows loading them with `weights_only=False` if they fail safe loading
# due to errors like 'restricted getattr' in newer PyTorch versions.
# WARNING: Only add files you absolutely trust, as this bypasses a security feature.
# Prefer using .safetensors files whenever possible.
